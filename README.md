About:

The inspiration for the game is my faith in Jesus Christ, and wanting to spread some information about The Bible and Christianity in a fun, light hearted way.

The controls are simple: just click on the answer you think is correct, and follow instructions on the buttons that appear!

Bugs:

One remaining bug is that the scores trcaker for some reason is unable to keep only the most recent score tracked, and keeps adding to the score indefinitely.
